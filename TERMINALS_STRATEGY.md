# Terminals.tech Launch Strategy

## Executive Summary

**Position**: "Git for Application State" - Version control for runtime
**Hero Feature**: Shareable replay links for any app crash/bug
**Business Model**: Open core with hosted replay infrastructure
**Target**: Every developer who's ever said "works on my machine"

## The 30-Day Launch Plan

### Week 1: Product Polish
**Goal**: Make the replay viewer absolutely magical

```typescript
// One-line integration
import terminals from '@terminals/core'
terminals.init({ 
  apiKey: 'term_free_key',
  autoReplay: true 
})

// Automatic on any error:
// â†’ Generates replay.terminals.tech/abc123
// â†’ Developer sees ENTIRE execution history
// â†’ Can step through time, inspect state
```

**Key Features**:
- Beautiful replay UI (like Loom meets Chrome DevTools)
- One-click share button
- "Powered by Terminals" watermark on free tier
- Export to Redux DevTools format

### Week 2: Documentation Trinity

**Only 3 pages needed**:

1. **terminals.tech/** 
   - Hero: "What if Ctrl+Z worked in production?"
   - 30-second demo video of debugging via replay
   - One-button "Try it now" with CodeSandbox

2. **terminals.tech/quickstart**
   ```bash
   npm install @terminals/core
   ```
   ```javascript
   // That's it. You now have:
   // âœ“ Unlimited undo/redo
   // âœ“ Time-travel debugging  
   // âœ“ Shareable bug replays
   // âœ“ Perfect error reproduction
   ```

3. **terminals.tech/replay**
   - Live examples of real bugs being debugged
   - Community hall of fame for interesting replays
   - Replay viewer embed for docs/blogs

### Week 3: Community Activation

**The Launch Sequence**:

**Day 1 - Hacker News**
```
Title: Show HN: I made state management work like Git
Body: 
After debugging "works on my machine" for the 1000th time, I built 
a 100-line event store that records everything. Any crash generates 
a shareable replay link. You can literally rewind production.

Demo: [replay.terminals.tech/hn-demo]
Code: [github.com/terminals/core] (MIT)
```

**Day 3 - Twitter/X Thread**
```
ðŸ§µ I just debugged a production bug in 30 seconds that would've taken hours.

The secret? Every user action is an event. Every bug becomes a replay.

Watch me fix a race condition by literally rewinding time: [video]

This is @terminals - Git for application state.
```

**Day 5 - Reddit Posts**
- r/programming: "Event sourcing should be the default, not an exception"
- r/webdev: "I made Redux with built-in time travel"
- r/reactjs: "useEventStore() - hooks with undo/redo built in"

**Day 7 - Dev.to Tutorial**
"Build Figma-style multiplayer with 50 lines of code"

### Week 4: Platform Integration

**The Standards Play**:

1. **OpenTelemetry Export**
   ```javascript
   terminals.export('opentelemetry') // Industry standard format
   ```

2. **Framework PRs**
   - Remix: "Add experimental replay support"
   - SvelteKit: "Event sourcing adapter"
   - Next.js: "Time-travel debugging RFC"

3. **Chrome Extension**
   - "Terminals DevTools" - See event stream for any site
   - Records even without integration
   - "Add Terminals" button for repo owners

## Viral Mechanics

**The K-Factor Formula**:

1. **Developer has bug** â†’ 
2. **Shares replay for help** â†’ 
3. **Helper sees Terminals** â†’ 
4. **Adopts for their project** â†’
5. **Cycle repeats**

**Viral Coefficient = 1.3** (each user brings 1.3 new users)

**Key Metrics**:
- Time to first replay: <5 minutes
- Replays shared per user: 3.2/week
- Conversion from viewer to user: 18%

## Revenue Projections

**Year 1 Targets**:
- 100,000 developers using free tier
- 2,000 paying teams (2% conversion)
- 20 enterprise customers
- ARR: $1.2M

**Year 2 Scale**:
- 1M developers
- 20,000 paying teams
- 200 enterprise
- ARR: $12M

## Competitive Moats

1. **Network Effects**: More replays = more debugging knowledge
2. **Data Gravity**: Event history becomes valuable over time
3. **Switching Costs**: Losing replay history is painful
4. **Developer Love**: We solve a real pain, not imaginary one
5. **Standards Control**: We define what replay format looks like

## Why This Wins

**For Developers**:
- Solves actual pain (debugging sucks)
- Immediate value (5-minute setup)
- Makes them look smart (share replays)

**For Companies**:
- Reduces MTTR by 10x
- Perfect bug reports from users
- Onboarding via replay viewing

**For Intuition Labs**:
- Viral growth built-in
- Natural expansion (replay â†’ sync â†’ AI)
- Platform dynamics (becomes infrastructure)

## The Vercel/Stackblitz Play

Don't ask for integration. Become inevitable:

1. **Get 10% of their users using Terminals**
2. **Users demand native integration**
3. **They approach us for partnership**
4. **We provide white-label solution**

Position: "We're not competing, we're infrastructure."

## Launch Assets Needed

- [ ] Logo/brand (minimal, developer-focused)
- [ ] Replay viewer UI (must be beautiful)
- [ ] 3-page website (hero, quickstart, replay)
- [ ] npm package (@terminals/core)
- [ ] GitHub repo with great README
- [ ] Demo video (30 seconds max)
- [ ] HN/Reddit accounts with karma

## Success Metrics

**Week 1**:
- 1,000 GitHub stars
- 100 replays shared
- 10 production adopters

**Month 1**:
- 10,000 developers
- 1,000 daily active replays
- First paying customer

**Month 6**:
- 100,000 developers
- $50K MRR
- One major framework adoption

## The Counterfactual Test

**If we DON'T do this**:
- Someone else will (Vercel, Sentry, DataDog)
- Developers keep suffering with console.log
- AI agents have no memory management
- We miss the developer tools gold rush

**If we DO this right**:
- Terminals becomes a verb ("just terminal it")
- Every bug report includes a replay
- We own the state management category
- $100M acquisition in 24 months

## Next Action

1. Polish replay viewer (3 days)
2. Create quickstart (1 day)  
3. Prepare HN launch (1 day)
4. Execute launch sequence (30 days)

**The moment developers see a production bug fixed via replay, we've won.**
