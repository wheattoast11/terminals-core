**Title**: Event sourcing should be the default, not an exception

**Post**:
I've been building web apps for 10 years, and I'm convinced we've been doing state management wrong.

Every app I've built has the same problems:
- Unreproducible bugs
- "Works on my machine"  
- State inconsistencies
- No audit trail
- Undo/redo is an afterthought

The solution has been staring us in the face: event sourcing. But we treat it like it's only for banks and enterprise.

I built a 100-line event store that makes event sourcing trivial. Every state change is an event. Every bug generates a replay link. You can literally rewind production.

```javascript
// Traditional (lossy)
setState({ count: 5 })  // Previous state is gone

// Event sourcing (lossless)
dispatch({ type: 'SET_COUNT', value: 5 })  // Full history preserved
```

The benefits are insane:
- Perfect debugging (replay any bug)
- Free undo/redo
- Natural audit trail
- Time-travel debugging
- Deterministic tests

Demo: https://replay.terminals.tech/demo
Code: https://github.com/terminals/core (MIT)

Why isn't this the default? The traditional argument is "performance" but that's BS - I can replay 10,000 events in 50ms with checkpointing.

Event sourcing should be opt-out, not opt-in. Change my mind.

**Title**: I made Redux with built-in time travel - 100 lines of code

**Post**:
Fed up with debugging "unreproducible" bugs, I built a state manager where every bug automatically generates a replay link.

**The problem**: User reports bug ‚Üí Can't reproduce ‚Üí Add logging ‚Üí Deploy ‚Üí Wait ‚Üí Still can't reproduce ‚Üí üò≠

**The solution**: Event sourcing by default

```javascript
import terminals from '@terminals/core'

const store = terminals.createStore({
  initial: { todos: [] },
  reducer: (state, event) => {
    // Your normal reducer logic
  }
})

// Now you have superpowers
store.undo()
store.redo()
store.rewind(50) // Go back 50 events
store.replay()   // Watch it all happen
```

When your app crashes, users automatically get a link like:
`replay.terminals.tech/bug_xyz123`

You click it and watch their exact session. The bug is obvious when you can see it happen.

**Live demo**: https://terminals.tech/playground

**It's not just Redux-compatible, it's better:**
- Works with React, Vue, Vanilla
- 100x smaller than Redux + middleware
- Automatic replay generation
- Built-in persistence
- Time-travel debugging

The entire core is 100 lines: https://github.com/terminals/core/blob/main/src/core/EventStore.ts

Free for 1000 replays/month. What bug are you going to catch first?

## r/reactjs

**Title**: useEventStore() - React hooks with undo/redo built in

**Post**:
Just shipped a React hook that gives you Redux-like state management with automatic undo/redo and debugging superpowers.

```jsx
import { useTerminals } from '@terminals/core/react'

function TodoApp() {
  const { state, dispatch, undo, redo, canUndo, canRedo } = useTerminals({
    initial: { todos: [] },
    reducer: (state, event) => {
      switch(event.type) {
        case 'ADD_TODO':
          return { todos: [...state.todos, event.payload] }
        default:
          return state
      }
    }
  })

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={undo} disabled={!canUndo}>‚ü≤</button>
      <button onClick={redo} disabled={!canRedo}>‚ü≥</button>
      {/* Your app */}
    </>
  )
}
```

**But here's the killer feature**: When your app crashes, it generates a replay link automatically.

User hits bug ‚Üí Gets link ‚Üí Sends to you ‚Üí You watch their exact session ‚Üí Fix bug immediately

No more "can't reproduce". Every bug is reproducible.

**Try it live**: https://codesandbox.io/s/terminals-react-demo

**Features**:
- TypeScript built-in
- DevTools integration
- Persist to localStorage
- Replay any session
- 0 dependencies
- 5KB gzipped

**Free tier**: 1000 replays/month
**Source**: https://github.com/terminals/core

Been using this in production for 3 months. Cut debugging time by 90%. Your move, Redux.

**Title**: Type-safe event sourcing in 100 lines of TypeScript

**Post**:
Built a fully type-safe event sourcing library that makes bugs reproducible and state manageable.

```typescript
// Define your events with discriminated unions
type Event = 
  | { type: 'INCREMENT'; payload: number }
  | { type: 'DECREMENT'; payload: number }
  | { type: 'RESET' }

// State is inferred from reducer
const store = createStore<Event>({
  initial: { count: 0 },
  reducer: (state, event) => {
    switch(event.type) {
      case 'INCREMENT': 
        return { count: state.count + event.payload }
      case 'DECREMENT':
        return { count: state.count - event.payload }  
      case 'RESET':
        return { count: 0 }
      // TypeScript ensures exhaustive handling
    }
  }
})

// Full type inference
store.dispatch({ type: 'INCREMENT', payload: 5 }) ‚úÖ
store.dispatch({ type: 'INCREMENT', wrong: 5 })   ‚ùå TypeScript error
```

**The magic**: Every event is recorded. Any crash generates a replay link. You can rewind, fast-forward, and branch time.

**Generics make it flexible**:
```typescript
class EventStore<E extends BaseEvent, S> {
  append(event: Omit<E, 'id' | 'timestamp'>): E
  project(): S
  navigate(to: number): void
  fork(): EventStore<E, S>
}
```

Full source (actually 100 lines): https://github.com/terminals/core/blob/main/src/core/EventStore.ts

The types are half the code and worth every line. Your state is your database - might as well type it properly.
