# Twitter/X Launch Thread

**Tweet 1:**
I just debugged a production bug in 30 seconds that would've taken hours.

The secret? Every user action is an event. Every bug becomes a replay.

Watch me fix a race condition by literally rewinding time: [video]

This is @terminals - Git for application state 🧵

**Tweet 2:**
The problem: "Works on my machine" 🤦‍♂️

User reports bug → Can't reproduce → Add logs → Deploy → Wait → Still can't reproduce → Add more logs → Deploy again → Give up → Mark as "can't reproduce"

We've all been there.

**Tweet 3:**
The solution: What if every bug came with a replay?

User hits bug → Automatic replay link → You watch their exact session → See the bug happen → Fix it immediately

Like Loom, but for your app's state.

**Tweet 4:**
Here's the magic moment - debugging a real production bug:

I can scrub through time, inspect any state, see every event. The bug is obvious when you can watch it happen.

**Tweet 5:**
The technical magic in 100 lines:

```javascript
// Every state change is an event
dispatch({ type: 'ADD_TODO', text: 'Ship it' })

// State is computed from events  
state = events.reduce(reducer, initial)

// Time travel is just changing index
state = events.slice(0, index).reduce(reducer)
```

**Tweet 6:**
Integration takes literally one line:

```javascript
import terminals from '@terminals/core'
terminals.init()
```

Now you have:
✓ Automatic error replays
✓ Undo/redo everywhere
✓ Time-travel debugging
✓ Perfect bug reports

**Tweet 7:**
This isn't just for debugging. Teams are using Terminals for:

- Customer support (watch user sessions)
- QA testing (replay = test case)
- Onboarding (learn by watching)
- Compliance (audit trail)
- AI agents (perfect memory)

**Tweet 8:**
The coolest part? It's MIT open source.

The core event store is 100 lines you can read and understand. No magic, just computer science.

We monetize the replay infrastructure, not the pattern.

**Tweet 9:**
Real numbers from production:
- 50ms to replay 10,000 events
- 100KB memory for 1,000 events
- 0.1ms overhead per state change
- 10x faster debugging (measured)

Performance was priority #1.

**Tweet 10:**
We're giving away 1,000 replays/month free forever.

No credit card. No tracking. Just npm install and go.

Because every developer deserves sane debugging.

What bug will you replay first? 🐛⏮️

**For "How is this different from Redux DevTools?"**
Great question! Redux DevTools shows current session only. Terminals persists across sessions, generates shareable links, and works with any state management (or none). Plus, your users can send you replays of their bugs.

**For "What about sensitive data?"**
Built-in redaction:
```javascript
terminals.init({
  redact: ['password', 'ssn', 'apiKey']
})
```
Events are stored locally by default. You control what gets uploaded.

**For "Performance concerns?"**
We use a ring buffer (max 10k events), checkpointing for fast replay, and lazy evaluation. Most apps use <1MB RAM. The overhead is less than a console.log.

**For "Why not use [LogRocket/FullStory/etc]?"**
Those record DOM/screenshots (huge bandwidth). We record events (tiny). Plus, you can run Terminals locally, own your data, and it's open source. Different philosophy: record intent, not pixels.
